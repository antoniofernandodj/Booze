Custom Validation Functions: Allow users to define their own custom validation functions for specific attributes. This would give more flexibility to users to enforce specific rules for data validation.

Nested Objects: Extend the library to support nested objects, where an attribute of a class can be another class instance, enabling the creation of complex data structures.

Inheritance: Implement support for inheritance, so that users can create subclasses that inherit and extend the attributes and validations from the parent class.

Error Handling: Enhance the error handling mechanism to provide more informative and user-friendly error messages, including details about which attribute failed the validation and why.

Type Conversions: Allow for automatic type conversions for some common data types, like converting strings to integers or floats where appropriate.

Required Fields: Introduce a mechanism to mark certain attributes as required, ensuring that they must be provided during object initialization.

Default Values: Allow users to specify default values for certain attributes, so if they are not provided during initialization, the default value will be used.

Serialization and Deserialization: Implement methods to serialize objects into JSON or other formats, as well as methods to deserialize data back into objects.

External Data Sources: Integrate the library with external data sources like databases or APIs, enabling seamless data retrieval and validation.

Composition: Add support for attribute composition, where an attribute can be composed of multiple sub-attributes with their own validations.

Validation Groups: Allow users to define validation groups, where different groups of attributes are validated under specific conditions or scenarios.

Data Pre-processing: Enable data pre-processing hooks, allowing users to modify or clean the data before validation.

Error Logging: Implement logging mechanisms to log validation errors and other important events for debugging and monitoring purposes.

Attribute Aliasing: Support attribute aliasing, allowing users to define multiple names for the same attribute, making the class more user-friendly.

Dependency Validation: Allow for attribute validations based on the values of other attributes, enabling more complex validation logic.

Caching: Introduce caching mechanisms to store and reuse validated data, improving performance for frequently validated objects.

Async Validation: Add support for asynchronous validation functions, suitable for environments that utilize asynchronous programming.

Circular Reference Handling: Handle circular references in object structures to prevent infinite loops during validation.

Immutable Objects: Implement a mechanism to make objects immutable after initialization, ensuring that their attributes cannot be modified.

Multiple Input Formats: Support the parsing and validation of data from various input formats, like YAML, XML, or CSV.
